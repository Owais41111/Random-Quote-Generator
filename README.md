# ✨ Random Quote Generator

Hi! 👋 I’m **Ejaz Ahmed**, and this is my simple yet inspiring web project **“Random Quote Generator”** – a responsive Random Quote Generator built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  

The app displays motivational quotes from famous authors, supports dark/light themes, and lets users copy quotes to their clipboard with a single click! 📋
